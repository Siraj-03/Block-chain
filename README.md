Decentralize-Voting-App-main is a blockchain-based voting application designed to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof digital voting experience. Built using Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity, the app ensures that all votes are recorded immutably on the blockchain, preventing fraud and manipulation. The frontend is developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and integrates Web3.js to enable seamless interaction between users and the Ethereum network. Voters can register, authenticate, and cast their votes anonymously, while election results are calculated and displayed in real time. This project utilizes tools like Truffle for smart contract development and testing, along with Metamask for wallet integration. Ideal for developers, educators, or organizations exploring decentralized governance solutions, this app serves as a foundational model for secure online voting systems.
